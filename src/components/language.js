      `Antonio (Tony) Adame was born on North Susan Street in Santa Ana to Francisco and Rosalba Adame;
      both were recent immigrants from Mexico with nothing to their names. He was raised in a family of 1 of
      6 boys what lived in a small 2-bedroom apartment on Susan until he moved across First Street to South
      Gunther Street where he grew up. His father, “Pancho”, was a mesero at a seafood restaurant in Orange
      for over 25 years and his mother, “Rosa” took care of looking after the children and home full time. Tony
      likes to call her a “domestic engineer”.`,
      `Growing up in a big family on a single source of income was tough but meant that they had to rely on
      alternative sources of supplemental income and community support to make ends meet. This meant
      collecting cans and other recyclables from Santa Anita Park and local business that were willing to
      donate their recyclables. Along with this, Tony had his first official “job” at the age of 13 as an assistant
      to a local soccer league organizer and announcer. Four days a week, his duties included travelling to
      different parks around the city to set up the announcers sound system, setting up the corner flags and
      goal nets, and using limestone power to draw the lines of the soccer fields. Tony and his brothers had to
      learn early on in their lives that they needed to find ways to contribute to the family in any way they
      could.`,
      `Tony and his brothers became heavily involved with the local community center at Santa Anita Park in
      his youth with helped with the strain at home. Here, he learned to fish, swim, play competitive sports,
      build a community, and volunteer vast amounts of his time. From the age of 6 to 16, the community
      center and the staff there shaped Tony’s formative years to ensure that he would be a productive
      member of society that cared for his neighbors and community.`,
      `Tony attended Russell Elementary School, Fitz Intermediate School and Los Amigos High School as a high
      performing Honors/AP student. He went on to attend Orange Coast College to earn his degree in
      Architecture/Design.`,
      `In 2009, Tony, along with his brother, Pete, and neighbor J-Bird, started selling hair pomade to try to
      fund a project to design and build a bratwurst restaurant in Santa Ana. This pomade venture developed
      into an internationally recognized company named Suavecito that now employs over 100 people, mainly
      from Santa Ana. Suavecito has since been recognized multiple times by the City of Santa Ana for its
      various contributions to the community and philanthropy efforts. Along with receiving many awards for
      excellence, Suavecito has been recognized in local and international publications for its story and strong
      branding that has been created from humble beginnings.`,
      `Tony, Pete and J-Bird have since continued reinvested their time and money into forming multiple other
      companies within Santa Ana and pride themselves on hiring local Santaneros in an effort to provide
      opportunities to those within their community.`,
      `Tony currently served as one of the founders and CFO of Suavecito and various other local companies.
      He likes to volunteer his time doing speaking engagements to tell his story and motive the youth in
      Santa Ana as a source of relatability and inspiration. He uses his name and resources to organize events
      to donate food and other necessities to those in need within his community.`

      `Tony owes and attributes much of his success today to the programs that Santa Ana made available to
      him and his family as a child and young adult. These programs included afterschool programs, youth
      sports, free summer lunch, community centers staffed my caring and charitable individuals, and clean
      and safe parks to play in.`,
      `As a teenager, Tony began to see these programs disappear and fall apart. Parks are in disrepair and
      empty. Community centers are no longer a place where families in the neighborhood congregate. It’s
      clear that the City’s focus and financial interest have shifted away from these programs at an
      embarrassing rate. Just take a look at Heritage Park, Rosita Park, Santa Anita Park, Windsor Park,
      Centennial Park and surrounding examples to see the years of neglect. We can do better.`,
      `The current pandemic has only widened the void created in the Parks and Recreation budget when the
      need for community is at its greatest.`,
      `Tony is committed to truly giving back to his community in a big way when it comes to redirecting
      attention back to our youth as we invest back into their futures. This has proven to have positive effects
      on his own life and will continue to with our current families and the communities.`

      been facing without much change for too long. The effects of homelessness have an impact throughout

      `As the effects of COVID-19 put more residents out of work, there is a greater need for work placement

      their mental illness or drug dependencies rather than incarceration. Tony will work to develop a county-
      wide approach to help residents get off the streets and into treatment centers and into temporary
      shelters. The County needs to be put on notice to make good on their commitment to share in the responsibility of building appropriate shelter space within their own communities. Tony will consider all

      `It is no secret that the cost of housing has grown significantly higher than that of real wages in Santa
      Ana. This imbalance not only creates serious financial stress on our families, it also has a negative effect
      on the environment and quality of life that our residents experience. This includes our public housing
      options being very limited or in disrepair, high occupancy of people living in a single space, and current
      occupants living with the stress of being able to afford the next rent or mortgage payment.`,
      `Tony lived through this first-hand. His family relied on once source of income to provide for a family of 8
      in a small two-bedroom space. There was a constant amount of anxiety from month-to-month with little
      to no government support.`,
      `There is a smart and level approach to help relieve tensions between renters and landlords that can
      satisfy both ends. Ensuring that we curb, or limit, rent increases gives renters assurance of where their
      financial future is headed while still being fair to the landlord. Ensuring mortgage relief opportunities for
      homeowners provides relief on the other end. Less displacements and less vacancies.`,
      `Along with this, public and affordable housing options have not been developed at rates to prevent the
      overcrowding that we are currently experiencing at a high level. Tony will focus on incentivizing the
      promotion of new development to meet the needs of our families. With COVID-19, these needs have
      become for visible and urgent.`,
      `We need to have pride in where we live and quality of our neighborhoods is a clear indication of such
      pride. Tony has always been proud to call Santa Ana his front yard and is committed to use his business
      experience to bridge the needs we have in housing that is still growing.`

      anonymity, even when they fully achieved Residency Status.`,
      `For too long, immigrants that, in many cases, are on the frontlines as essential workers have stayed in
      the shadows of our community without any government support. Tony knows that it is the duty of our
      local government to have an effort in place of informing ALL residents of Santa Ana of their rights and
      opportunities as immigrants. This not only promotes honor within our residents, but also creates a safer
      community of inclusion rather than exclusion.`,
      `This includes more access to immigration legal defenses that are vital in keeping our families from being

      tax dollars, helping create a positive image for Santa Ana, hiring local Santa Ana residents, promoting
      charities to help our communities, and serving as a positive example to our youth as a source of
      inspiration.`,
      `For Santa Ana to remain competitive and attract the type of businesses that create jobs and bring in tax
      revenue, there needs to be a proper level of incentives to allow for that. This may come in the form of
      tax credits, but Santa Ana more importantly needs to create a healthy and well-equipped workforce
      within clean and attractive neighborhoods.`,
      `This comes with the need to create an efficient City Hall for business owners to receive permits for
