    english: [
      `Antonio (Tony) Adame was born on North Susan Street in Santa Ana to Francisco and Rosalba Adame; both were recent immigrants from Mexico with nothing to their names. He was raised in a family of 1 of 6 boys that lived in a small 2-bedroom apartment on Susan until he moved across First Street to South Gunther Street where he grew up. His father, “Pancho”, was a mesero at a seafood restaurant in Orange for over 25 years and his mother, “Rosa” took care of looking after the children and home full-time. Tony likes to call her a “domestic engineer”. `,
      `Growing up in a big family on a single source of income was tough but it meant that they had to rely on alternative sources of supplemental income and different levels of community support to make ends meet. Tony’s family would collect cans and other recyclables from Santa Anita Park and local businesses that were willing to donate their recyclables to help a family in need. Along with this, Tony had his first official “job” at the age of 13 as an assistant to a local soccer league organizer/announcer. Four days a week, his duties included travelling to different parks around the city to set up the announcers sound system, put up the corner flags and goal nets, and using limestone power to draw the lines of the soccer fields before each game. Tony and his brothers had to learn early on in their lives that they needed to find ways to contribute to the family in any way they could. `,
      `Tony and his brothers became heavily involved with the local community center at Santa Anita Park in his youth which helped with the strain at home. Here, he learned to fish, swim, play competitive sports, build a community, and volunteer vast amounts of his time. From the age of 6 to 16, the community center and the staff there shaped Tony’s formative years to ensure that he would be a productive member of society that cared for his neighbors and community.`,
      `Tony attended Russell Elementary School, Fitz Intermediate School and Los Amigos High School as a high performing Honors/AP student. He went on to attend Orange Coast College to earn his degree in Architecture/Design. `,
      `In 2009, Tony, along with his brother, Pete, and neighbor J-Bird, started selling hair pomade to try to fund a project to design and build a bratwurst restaurant in Santa Ana. This pomade venture developed into an internationally recognized company named Suavecito that now employs over 100 people, mainly from Santa Ana. Suavecito has since been recognized multiple times by the City of Santa Ana for its various contributions to the community and philanthropy efforts. Along with receiving many awards for excellence, Suavecito has been recognized in local and international publications for its story and strong branding that has been created from humble beginnings.`,
      `Tony, Pete and J-Bird have since continued reinvested their time and money into forming multiple other companies within Santa Ana and pride themselves on hiring local Santaneros in an effort to provide opportunities to those within their community.`,
      `Tony currently served as one of the founders and CFO of Suavecito and various other local companies. He likes to volunteer his time doing speaking engagements to tell his story and motivate the youth in Santa Ana as a source of relatability and inspiration. He uses his name and resources to organize events to donate food and other necessities to those in need within his community.`

      `Tony owes and attributes much of his success today to the programs that Santa Ana made available to him and his family as a child and young adult. These programs included afterschool programs, youth sports, free summer lunch, community centers staffed by caring and charitable individuals, and clean and safe parks to play in.`,
      `As a teenager, Tony began to see these programs disappear and fall apart. Parks are now in disrepair and empty. Community centers are no longer a place where families in the neighborhood congregate. It’s clear that the City’s focus and financial interest have shifted away from these programs at an alarming rate. Just take a look at Heritage Park, Rosita Park, Santa Anita Park, Windsor Park, Centennial Park and surrounding examples to see what the years of neglect has done to these spaces. We will do better.`,
      `The current pandemic has only widened the void created in the Parks and Recreation budget at a time when the need for community is at its greatest.`,
      `Tony is committed to truly giving back to his community in a big way when it comes to redirecting attention and resources back to our youth programs as we invest in their futures. This has proven to have positive effects on his own life and he is indebted to do the same to our current families and communities.`

Civilian responders, field operators with knowledge of mental illness and a public safety oversight committee that all much have the interest of our residents at heart are needed and are being demanded by our community.`,

      `As the effects of COVID-19 put more residents out of work, there is a greater need for work placement services and access to emergency health care than ever before.`,
      `Along with this, those that are homeless should be treated less like criminals as many need help with their mental illness or drug dependencies rather than incarceration. Tony will work to develop a county-wide approach to help residents get off the streets and into treatment centers and temporary shelters. The County will be put on notice that they must make good on their commitment to enforce every city within the county to share in the responsibility of building appropriate shelter space within their own communities. Tony will consider all legal options in order to push for this to happen.`

      `It is no secret that the cost of housing has grown significantly faster than that of real wages in Santa Ana. This imbalance not only creates serious financial stress on our families, it also has a negative effect on the environment and quality of life that our residents experience. This includes our public housing options being very limited or in disrepair, high occupancy of people living in a single space, and adding stress to families living with the uncertainty of whether or not they can afford their next rent or mortgage payment.`,
      `Tony lived through this first-hand. His family relied on one source of income to provide for a family of 8 in a small two-bedroom space. There was a constant amount of anxiety every month in his house about making ends meet with little to no government support.`,
      `There is a smart and level approach to help relieve tensions between renters and landlords that can satisfy both ends. Ensuring that we curb, or limit, rent increases gives renters the security of knowing where their financial future is headed while still being fair to the landlord. Ensuring mortgage relief opportunities for homeowners provides relief on the other end resulting in fewer displacements and fewer vacancies.`,
      `Along with this, public and affordable housing options have not been developed at rates to prevent the overcrowding that we are currently experiencing at a high level. Tony will focus on incentivizing the promotion of new development to meet the needs of our families. With COVID-19, these needs have become visible and urgent.`,
      `We need to have pride in where we live and the improving quality of our neighborhoods will be a clear indication of such pride. Tony has always been proud to call Santa Ana his front yard and is committed to use his business experience to bridge the growing housing crisis facing our community.`

      `For too long, immigrants that, in many cases, are on the frontlines as essential workers have stayed in the shadows of our community without any government support. Tony knows that it is the duty of our local government to have an effort in place of informing ALL residents of Santa Ana of their rights and opportunities as immigrants. This not only promotes honor within our residents, but also creates a safer community of inclusion rather than exclusion.`,
      `This includes more access to immigration legal defense that is vital to keeping our families from being unnecessarily separated. Tony believes that all taxpayers should have access to these benefits, regardless of their documented status.`

      `He is living proof that the opportunities created by a fair and equitable Santa Ana is a good investment for the City. Tony was raised in large part by the programs offered at Santa Anita Community Center and he has in turn re-invested himself back into the City by opening various small businesses that generate tax dollars, helping create a positive image for Santa Ana, hiring local Santa Ana residents, promoting charities to help our communities, and serving as a source of inspiration and a positive example to our youth.`,
      `For Santa Ana to remain competitive and attract the type of businesses that create jobs and bring in tax revenue, there needs to be a proper level of incentives to allow for that. This may come in the form of tax credits, but Santa Ana more importantly needs to create a healthy and well-equipped workforce within clean and attractive neighborhoods.`,
      `This comes with the need to create an efficient City Hall for business owners to receive permits for improvements that would only further serve our community. Outdated processes have made growing a business in Santa Ana harder. Tony has the personal experience to address these issues and offer solutions that would greatly satisfy our business community. `
